# Telldus API integration
This is a tiny integration towards the Telldus API with a web client showing the result. The connection towards the API is done via OAuth and the credentials can be fetched from the Telldus website.

## NOTE
This app was written a while ago and contains old dependencies such as jQuery and Ajax. It also doesn't use the latest ES7 syntax. It's also very very basic :)
